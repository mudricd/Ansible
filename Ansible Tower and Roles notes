1. To use the roles with ansible tower:
In repo (git) create folder for the playbook (repo is the source for Projects).
For example: kibana_playbook
Then copy your playbook into it.
In the same folder create folder roles and copy your role into it.
2. Before running job make sure that you can access from container awx_task to the node. Create the key on the container and coppy it onto hosts.
3. Also note that every path specified in your playbook is related to awx_task container. I had a problem with template paths and I figured out that I had to copy template file into the comtainer.
awx_task container is control node.
4. By default tower runs jobs with user admin. To change default user edit ansible.cfg and uncomment #remote_user = root

TO BE DONE AFTER TOWER SET UP:
HOSTS FILE
COPY TOWERS KEY TO THE HOSTS
CREATE KIBANA TEMPLATE ON TOWER
UPDATE HOSTS FILE ON ALL MACHINES FROM CF TEMPLATE - Ansible-playbook hosts_file.yaml
